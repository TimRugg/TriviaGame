# TriviaGame
Learn to use timers
A trivia game presenting questions to be answered within a specific set time. Timers will automatically advance the game. The only user input will be guessing the correct answer and choosing to play again. 
The questions will be stored within an object also storing the correct answer and additional incorrect answers. A function will also be included to randomize an array of correct answer, question, and incorrect choices. This will enable the screen to display on screen the data in array from index 1. Index 0 will contain the correct answer to be checked.
